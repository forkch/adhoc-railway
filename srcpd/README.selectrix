Purpose:
In this document the differences between a Maerklin/Intellibox and
Selectrix control center is explained and the consequences for the SRCP
implementation with the Selectrix protocol (SX_bus only).
In the sources selectrix.c and selectrix.h is a translation module
programmed that the bit command normal with Maerklin and Intellibox
translates to a byte transport. Different elements are treated
different. But an implementation of the GL, GA and FB commands of SRCP
is done.

GL (controlling an engine) translation:
A GL on SCRP is on a Maerklin/Intellibox system the same as on a
Selectrix system. It is on all systems a multiple bit command. A
Selectrix decoder accepts the following command:

- Bit 4 ï¿½ bit 0:	Speed of the engine (0 = stop, 31 = max speed)
- Bit 5:		Direction of the engine (0 = forward, 1 = backward)
- Bit 6:		Light on/off (0 = off, 1 = on)
- Bit 7:		Function on/off (0 = off, 1 = on) 

With the SRCP the command for an engine would be:
SET busnumber GL engineaddress direction speed light function where:

busnumber		Number of the Selectrix bus
engineaddress		Address of the engine on the SX-bus
direction		Direction of the engine (2= emergency stop)
speed			Speed of the engine
light			State of the engine lights
function 		State of the engine function

GA (controlling switches and signals) translation:
A GA on SCRP is on a Maerklin/Intellibox system a one bit instruction.
Every switch or signal can be addressed individually. After a predefined
time the switch must be turned off. On the SX-bus (Selectrix)
8 switches are controlled in one action. The switch controller turns
the switch command off.

In the SCRP server the switch turn off command is generated from
software. The client doesn't have to turn off the switches. This makes
the implementation of the switches as follows:

SET busnumber GA switchcontroller switchport switchvalue, where:

busnumber	     Number of the Selectrix bus
switchcontroller     Address of switch controller on the SX-bus
switchport	     Number from 1 to 8 (giving the number of port the
                     switch is connected to)
switchvalue          0 Normal, <>0 Thrown

FB (Feedback contacts from track) translation:
A FB on SCRP is on a Maerklin/Intellibox system a bitstream
(packets of 16 bits), which is read from the controller with a byte
instruction. This is in SCRP converted to a one bit instruction. On a
Selectrix system it is also a byte which is located on the SX-bus. A
'bitstream' of 8 bits is read from the SX-bus. An other 'bitstream'
is read from the SX-bus at a different address.

In the SRCP several FB contacts are translated to single
contacts. They are located in a big row. To let the Selectrix
implementation make such a stream there has to be a further
initialization to be done. The SX-bus addresses of the feedback contacts
have to be given to the SCRP server. This is done by the command

  INIT <busnumber> FB <addressfeedback> S <numberfeedback>

addressfeedback:  Physical address on SX-bus
numberfeedback:    Number from 1 to 112. There may be gaps between the
                   numbers.
if addressfeedback is -1 then the configuration from the xml file is taken 
and the process of obtaining feedback status is started. No further 
initialisation is requered.

The feedbacks are checked by:

  INFO <busnumber> FB <feedbacknumber>
or
  GET <busnumber> FB <feedbacknumber>

Implementation:
In the SRCP server the SX-bus is in an array in the structure Selectrix
data. Every action with the SX-bus is done after reading the other bits
of the target address. The byte send to the SX-bus is also placed in the
array, so the array is up to date. This is done inside the IO thread,
to make the data in the array thread-save.
In a second array the addresses of the feedback modules are stored.
In a separate counter the number of feedback modules is counted.
The thread will process the data to and from the message queue.
