1. Introduction

AdHoc-Railway is a Java-GUI to control a model railway over the SRCP-Protocol. 
It is very simple to setup and drive immediately without having a complete map of 
the railway on the screen.
AdHoc-Railway is designed to be used in a Multiuser-Environment. This means
that many persons can control the whole railway and each AdHoc-Railway-Instance 
is informed about the changes on the railway which were made by the other 
users.
It uses the jsrcpc-Library to communicate with a srcp-server.

2. Installation

AdHoc-Railway needs the xerces-java library in order to save and load its configuration,
see that you have them installed. The jsrcpc-library is already in the binary-distribution included.

3. Run

Just download the .jar-Version and start it via
	% java -jar AdHoc-Railway.jar

4. Build from source

To build AdHoc-Railway from source copy the actual jsrcpc-library into the lib-directory and update the link.

4. Usage

TBD.

5. Image-Source

All images used in the AdHoc-Railway are coming either from the KDE-Project or 
from the SpDrS60-Project. Both are distributed under the terms of the GPL.
