1. Introduction

AdHoc-Railway is a Java-GUI to control a model railway over the SRCP-Protocol. 
It is very simple to setup and drive immediately without having a complete map of 
the railway on the screen.
AdHoc-Railway is designed to be used in a Multiuser-Environment. This means
that many persons can control the whole railway and each AdHoc-Railway-Instance 
is informed about the changes on the railway which were made by the other 
users.
It uses the jsrcpc-Library (http://sourceforge.net/projects/jsrcpc) to 
communicate with a srcp-server.

2. Installation
AdHoc-Railway works with files or a database as datastorage.

If you want to use a database as datastorage install a MySQL-server, create a 
database and execute the SQL-Script adhocrailway.sql in the db/ directory

Adjust the database settings accordingly in the file adhocrailway.conf (copy adhocrailway.conf.sample). Below is an example:
UseDatabase=true
DatabaseHost=localhost
DatabaseName=adhocrailway
DatabaseUser=adhocrailway
DatabasePWD=adhocrailway

3. Run

Just download the .jar-Version and start it via
	% java -jar AdHoc-Railway.jar

4. Build from source

There is an Ant-Buildfile in the root folder of the source-distribution use this
